#Building my first CRUD!
Creating my first CRUD using NodeJS modules.
##Why using only NodeJS modules?
Off course frameworks like express would help a lot on building a 
simple crud like this, but the main reason of not using extern modules 
is LEARNING. I was interested about how does Node works underneath express 
and then tried to build a simple app to learn more about NodeJS itself.
##What did i learn doing this?
This is almost my first experience creating a server and client side app,
so i could learn a lot more about how the HTTP protocol works, and how i could
make client side "talk" to the server side, for me it became much more clear that
backend development is more fun to me, and this little project made me really excited to learn more.
